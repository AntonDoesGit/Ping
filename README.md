# üèì Ping!
### What is Ping!
Ping! is a small Python game project, parodying one of the most famous games of all time ‚Äî Pong. Instead of featuring two players and two paddles, Ping! needs only one player to play and ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî one paddle to control. The main objective of the game is to make the ball bounce off the paddle and not touch the bottom of the window.

### What I might add
I will list here all the features I might add to the later versions of Ping!. Some of these concepts might "hit the cutting room floor", but some will actually be implemented, either in main or testing versions.
* Title screen
* Different ball and paddle textures
* More gameplay features
  - Breakable bricks (a reference to Atari's Breakout, break the bricks with the ball)
  - Flying aliens (a reference to Space Invaders aliens, damage the alien with the ball)
  - Power-ups (e.g giving free score points, spawning another ball, temporarily slowing down the ball)
